# Data-cleaning-with-mysql

a data cleaning project from AlexTheAnalyst(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rO7ztF4NtU&t=2713s)

I first converted the dataset into a JSON format to facilitate the import process into MySQL Workbench. Then, using the PyMySQL library in Python, I replaced the empty cells with NULL values to ensure proper handling of missing data within the database.

In the project, I utilized MySQL to address data type issues, standardize the dataset, and remove unused columns, thereby enhancing the utility and clarity of the data.
